  abstract={We present a 50-line MATLAB implementation of the lowest order virtual element method for the two-dimensional Poisson problem on general polygonal meshes. The matrix formulation of the method is discussed, along with the structure of the overall algorithm for computing with a virtual element method. The purpose of this software is primarily educational, to demonstrate how the key components of the method can be translated into code.},
